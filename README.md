I had a school project that was the final for the semester. We needed to make a website for an online sience museum. We needed to imply everything we learned from the semester and the different course assignments. This ment that we need to design our own design for the website, using figma. We need to code using HTML & CSS. Finally we needed to follow a GHANT chart or a Trello we made.

The target audience was for the most kids and young adult. That’s why when I designed the website I made sure that I had that in my mind. I wanted to have fresh colors and as many colors possible for the kids and adults alike could find this museum appealing and up to modern fashion. I had a black-pink  linear gradient color that I choose as the main theme. This colors I applied in my header and footer alike. I made sure that the hero image was the most colorful and fancy picture available from the image document and made different «cards for the different events and exhibitions. I made sure that the different pages followed the same concept of colorful cards.

The home page have a hero-image that is an eye catcher. This image is followed by a text about the silence museum. I wanted to drift away from the boring gritty looking since museum and give it a fresh setting. That’s why every card on the page got it unique color. Special events and exhibitions is the first to come when you scroll down. This because I meant it was the most special cards and eye-catching for the consumers. This is followed by an exhibition spaces. This is a short summary of the different exhibitions in the museum. The color is also chosen wisely to match the image. Every card have a button inside that lead you direct to the tickets slide. 

If you press the menu button you get lead to a menu page. This page have four different sections that also can be used as buttons that leads you to the other pages. Explore pages uses the same concept as the home page with the cards and images. 

Contact & about page also have colorful cards but this sections is without images as it have an image of the museum as an hero image. Here you can see the location, open hours, admission and more. The get involved page follows the same concept as the contact page. Colorful cards without images as it makes it easier to read.

The buttons and cards have a hoover effects over it and the buttons change colors when you hoover over it. The cards changes border radius. The tickets section have a form that you can fill out and the press the button. You get directed to the confirmation page and there is a custom made qr-code. If you can scan it, it should lead you to the picture of your ticket. The ticket is inspired from the original tickets for the MUNCH-museum in Oslo,Norway.
